# Sandpack + Eleventy

Sandpack is a new tool from CodeSandbox that lets you add an interactive code editor, with a build step, to a React app. The build step happens in the browser!

This is my attempt to create a playground for Eleventy. It's based on Vite's react-swc template.

It almost works, but the live reloading isn't working yet.

You can view the demo here: [https://sandpack-eleventy.vercel.app/](https://sandpack-eleventy.vercel.app/)

To get up and running:
- `git clone` this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.
